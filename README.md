# TIGr-Python-Parser
Made for the 2019 Ara Advanced Programming (In Python) Class


## Josiah and Tom Created Files:

* Reader
* TKCMD
* TKDrawer


## Josiah and Marcus Created Files:

* ParserMike
* TDrawer
* LookupArgParser


## Marcus and Tom Created Files:

* (INSERT FILES HERE)


## Josiah and Tom Points and Reasoning:

* Interactive Front-End x2
* Command Line Switches x2
* Outputs with TKinter x2
* Supports Piping and Scripting x2


## Josiah and Marcus Points and Reasoning:

* Parsed from Configurable Lookup Table x12:
	
	* More Flexible
	* It easier to add new functions to lookup table than adding functions to the class directly
  
* Outputs with turtle x2:

  * More Functional
  * We added more drawing functions to enhance the drawe
  
* Interactive front-end x2:

  * More Functional
  * Users can input commands dynamically instead of inputting a .txt file
  
* Command line switches x2:

  * More Flexible
  * Users can switch between different drawers with command switches
  
* Uses generic parsing engine x2:
  
  * More robust
  * Users can input slightly incorrect commands (e.g. 'C           100' and it will still work)


## Marcus and Tom Points and Reasoning:

* Output with Pygame x2:

	* More functional
	* We add more drawing functions to enhance the drawer


## Files that were worked on by both teams:

* TXTDrawer
* Main
